# Backtesting and Optimization of Intraday Trading Strategies
 
### Project Overview
This project involves designing and implementing an intraday trading strategy using technical indicators such as Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP). The strategy aims to optimize buy/sell signals and maximize returns through rigorous backtesting and parameter optimization.

### Key Features
- Intraday Trading Strategy: Developed a trading strategy using EMA and VWAP indicators to identify optimal entry and exit points.
- Backtesting Framework: Implemented backtesting logic to evaluate the historical performance of the strategy.
- Parameter Optimization: Fine-tuned strategy parameters to maximize returns, achieving a 21.5% total return with a Sharpe Ratio of 0.675.
- Performance Metrics: Evaluated the strategy based on metrics such as Total Return, Maximum Drawdown, Win Rate, and more.
- Python-Based Implementation: Built using Python with powerful libraries for technical analysis and backtesting.

### Technical Stack
- Languages: Python
- Libraries: pandas, pandas_ta, Backtesting.py
- Tools: Jupyter Notebook for development, Matplotlib for data visualization
 
### How It Works
- Data Loading: Historical price and volume data is loaded into the framework for analysis.
- Indicator Calculation: EMA and VWAP indicators are computed to signal buy/sell decisions.
- Backtesting: The strategy is tested on historical data to assess performance.
- Optimization: Parameters (e.g., EMA window size) are optimized to improve profitability.
- Performance Analysis: Strategy is evaluated using financial metrics such as Return, Drawdown, and Sharpe Ratio.
  
### Results
- Achieved a 21.5% total return during the backtesting period.
- Maintained a Sharpe Ratio of 0.675, reflecting a good risk-adjusted return.
- Provided insights into market behavior through quantitative analysis.
  
### Usage
- Clone the repository and install required libraries.
- Run the Jupyter Notebook to see the backtesting and optimization process in action.
- Customize parameters and datasets for experimenting with new strategies.
